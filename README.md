# Pizza Shop Recommender – Learn k-NN the Fun Way!

What if you could predict which pizza shop you'd like — based on your friends' past preferences?  
This project brings the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm to life using a relatable and tasty analogy.

---

## 🍕 Project Description

We’ve collected data from 10 friends on:
- How far a pizza shop was from them
- Price level
- Their personal ratings
- Whether they chose to go there

Our goal?  
> Predict whether **you** would choose a pizza shop — based on what your friends liked — using **k-NN**!

This project is ideal for **beginners in Machine Learning** who want a simple, fun, and visually intuitive way to understand how k-NN works.

| Feature        | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Distance_km    | Distance of the shop from the person        |
| Price_Level    | Price (1 = Low, 5 = High)                   |
| Rating         | Rating out of 5                             |
| Chose_Shop     | 1 = Yes, 0 = No (did the friend choose it?)|
